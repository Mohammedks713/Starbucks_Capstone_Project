# Starbucks_Capstone_Project
Starbucks Capstone Project for Udacity Machine Learning Course

For this project, I utilized the following software, libraries, and data:
portfolio.json, profile.json, transcript.json as found in the Starbucks Capstone Workspace in the Udacity Final Project module.
matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, and numpy in Jupyter Notebook using python 3 kernel running in the virtual workspace.
I used python 3. All the executable code should be in the ipynb new(1) file. 
The json data files are uploaded as zipped files due to size constraints.
